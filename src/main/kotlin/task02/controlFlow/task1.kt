 *
 * The major difference between If statements in Java and Kotlin
 * is that in Kotlin "if" is an expression. This also means that Kotlin does not have the
 * ternary operator.

 * The classical way of writing a max function in Java could be something like:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * TODO: write the body of the max function.
