/** Infix functions
 * Extension functions can also be prefixed with the infix keyword. This means that functions can be called without
 * the dot and parentheses! Infix methods has to have one, and only one, parameter, which must not be vararg or have
 * a default value.
 *
 * Define an extension infix method on the String class called task04. It should convert itself to int(maybe the
 * stdlib has an extension function for this?) and return itself times the parameter.
 *
 * Syntax:
 * infix <Extension function with one parameter>
